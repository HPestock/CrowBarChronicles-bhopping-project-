I've spent a few months creating a game in Unity that implements HL2 Old Engine style bunnyhopping. All of the project code
is open source, and is included in the download. If you do add to this and publish your project, just make sure to reference
my github repo. 

This was created using Unity 2019.3.4f1 and uploaded on 6/2/2020.
